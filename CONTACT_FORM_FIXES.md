# Contact Form Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Broken redirect to /thanks page**: The form was redirecting to a non-existent `/thanks` page after submission
2. **Form submission not working**: The form wasn't properly submitting to Netlify
3. **Missing success/error handling**: No feedback was shown to users after form submission
4. **Form name mismatch**: The form had inconsistent naming that could cause issues

## What Was Changed

### 1. Contact Component (`src/components/Contact.astro`)
- Removed `action="/thanks"` redirect
- Fixed form name to be consistent (`name="contact"`)
- Added inline success and error message displays
- Implemented proper form submission handling with JavaScript
- Added loading states and form reset functionality
- Improved reCAPTCHA integration and error handling

### 2. Removed Broken Page
- Deleted `src/pages/thanks.astro` since it's no longer needed

### 3. Netlify Configuration
- Added security headers for better form handling
- Form submissions now go directly to the homepage with inline success messages

## How It Works Now

1. **User fills out the form** with name, email, and message
2. **reCAPTCHA verification** is required before submission
3. **Form submits to Netlify** via POST to the homepage
4. **Success message appears** inline on the homepage
5. **Form resets** automatically, including reCAPTCHA
6. **No page redirects** - everything happens on the homepage

## Features Added

- ✅ Inline success/error messages
- ✅ Loading states during submission
- ✅ Form validation and reCAPTCHA verification
- ✅ Automatic form reset after successful submission
- ✅ Smooth scrolling to messages
- ✅ Better error handling with specific messages
- ✅ Hover effects and improved button styling

## Technical Details

- Form uses `data-netlify="true"` for Netlify integration
- JavaScript handles form submission asynchronously
- reCAPTCHA is properly integrated and verified
- Form data is submitted using `FormData` and `URLSearchParams`
- All messages are shown inline without page navigation
- Form inputs have proper IDs for JavaScript targeting

## Testing

The form should now:
1. Submit successfully to Netlify
2. Show a green success message
3. Reset all fields and reCAPTCHA
4. Not redirect to any external pages
5. Handle errors gracefully with specific messages
